    <h1>Hello, Codeworks!</h1>
    <h3>It's Veronica!</h3>
    <p>I'd never really used command prompt before so I learned a lot. I'd never done the server or used localhost
        basically I learned all the new things. The hot keys where somewhat knew. I speak spanish. It was actually
        my first language though you wouldn't know by looking at me. My mom is from Idaho but my dad is from Zacatecas, Mexico.
        So there you go.
